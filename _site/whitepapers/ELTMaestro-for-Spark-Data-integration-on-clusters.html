<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Spark represents an important milestone in the effort to make computing
on clusters practical and generally available.</p>

<p>Hadoop / MapReduce, introduced the early 2000s, allows clusters to be
built from commodity hardware by implementing fault tolerance of the
cluster’s nodes – so a multi-node system could survive the crash of an
individual node. But the MapReduce paradigm involves many iterations of
high-volume dataflows between memory and disk, which impact performance
and make MapReduce unsuited for many of the kinds of computations that
data scientists want to use clusters for.</p>

<p>More recently, Spark has received a great deal of attention, and has in
many cases become a de facto replacement for MapReduce, as it addresses
many of MapReduce’s shortcomings. Spark can perform more of its
computation in memory without landing data to disk, which in many cases
gives Spark order-of-magnitude performance advantages over MapReduce.
Spark is written in Scala and leverages the Scala functional programming
model to implement fault tolerance. Scala also provides Spark with a
convenient and popular API.</p>

<p>Spark contains rich structures called <em>dataframes</em> which are used to
represent relational tables. Dataframes are <em>distributed,</em> meaning that
parts of them live on each node in the cluster. The result is that
relational operations on dataframes, such as joins, filters, and
aggregations take place in parallel, and are very efficient. This makes
Spark clusters potentially very useful as data warehousing and business
intelligence platforms, since the ability to do such operations on large
tables quickly is precisely what DW and BI platforms require.</p>

<p>Spark clusters also have a distinct <em>dis</em>advantage as a DW/BI platform
– namely, that unlike traditional DW/BI platforms like DataStage or
Informatica, there is a dearth of tools for loading relational data into
them, and for transforming and organizing that data into the forms
required by DW/BI applications. Spark is rapidly evolving, and it is not
always easy for developers to keep up with the latest practices. In
fact, important changes to Spark have occurred while this paper was
being written. Spark has the potential to change the way data
warehousing is done, making large scale warehouses more ubiquitous and
easier to build -- but its attractive aspects of efficiency and low
cost are surrounded by a thorny wall of inaccessibility.</p>

<p>ELTMaestro for Spark is our solution to address this gap – the sword
that cuts through the wall of thorns. ELTMaestro for Spark is a new data
integration tool that allows users to load, transform, and organize data
on Spark clusters using an intuitive visual dataflow language that is
familiar to users of traditional ETL tools such as Informatica or
DataStage. Unlike traditional ETL tools, however, ELTMaestro for Spark
is powered by the Spark cluster itself and has no independent
transformation engine. This fact has important consequences in terms of
the <em>cost</em>, <em>complexity</em>, and <em>performance</em> of the system – simply put,
ELTMaestro for Spark is superior to traditional ETL in all three
dimensions.</p>

<p>Figure 1</p>

<p>In the next few sections we’ll explain some of the principles underlying
ELTMaestro for Spark, place ELTMaestro for Spark in the context of other
data integration tools and introduce some of ETLMaestro for Spark’s
advanced features.</p>

<h2 id="eltmaestro-for-spark-an-elt-solution">ELTMaestro for Spark: An ELT solution</h2>

<p>ELTMaestro for Spark is based on an architectural concept called <em>ELT.</em>
To understand the advantages of ELTMaestro for Spark over other data
integration tools, it is necessary to understand the difference between
ETL and ELT and the reasons why ELT, when feasible, is preferred.</p>

<h3 id="a-brief-history-of-etl">A brief history of ETL</h3>

<p><img src="/whitepapers/img/spark/image6.png" alt="" />
Figure 2</p>

<p>When data engineers first began to develop data warehouses, they
basically architected them according to the diagram in Figure 2. Figure
2 is essentially a physical embodiment of how the data engineers thought
about the problem – “You have to <em><strong>e</strong>xtract</em> that data from the
operational systems (i.e., the sources), rearrange (that is,
<em><strong>t</strong>ransform</em>) the data into the form needed for access by analysts,
and then <em><strong>l</strong>oad</em> it in that form to a location where it can be
accessed.”</p>

<p>There were (and are) well-developed schools of thought –notably, those
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Kimball">[Ralph
Kimball]{.underline}</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Inmon">[Bill Inmon]{.underline}</a> –
about how the data should be organized so that analysts using the
warehouse would be able to access what they needed most easily, and so
that the warehouse would grow in a manageable way over time. It was
generally thought that the success of the data warehouse depended on
getting this organization right.</p>

<p>In this environment, the ETL Server was considered a critical component
– the ETL server, after all, is the component responsible for the
organization of the data warehouse. With data volumes inexorably
increasing, ETL servers, including the software that ran on them, grew
ever more complex and expensive. Today, ETL servers for large DWs
running IBM DataStage, Informatica, or Ab Initio can be expected to cost
on the order of a million dollars.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, trouble developed on the right side of Figure 2. Despite all
the attention paid to organizing the data in the DW according the
theories of Kimball or Inmon, data in the DW was found to to be
increasingly inaccessible. The problem was not so much one of warehouse
design, rather one of mismatched tools. It was not initially
well-understood that data warehouses were fundamentally different from
other kinds of databases. Designers felt that if the data in the
warehouse were properly organized, then it would perform properly – but
less attention was paid to the database the warehouse was built on,
which was often whatever OLTP database was handy – Oracle, DB2, etc.</p>

<p>It turns out that databases can be tuned in two different ways: They can
be tuned to handle <em>many small transactions</em> – where “many” means
perhaps millions per day, and “small” means affecting a handful of rows
per transaction. This is what the databases sitting behind typical
retail operations do. On the other hand, they can handle a <em>few large
transactions</em> – where “a few” means perhaps a hundred per day, and
“large” means affecting millions or even billions of rows per
transaction. This first type of databases is called an <em>OLTP</em> (for
<em>online transactional processing</em>) database. We’ll call the second type
a <em>data warehouse</em> (or <em>DW</em>) <em>platform</em>.</p>

<p>Databases are either good at OLTP or DW, but not both. Place
sufficiently heavy data-warehouse-type demands on an OLTP database, and
it will founder. If the database on the right in Figure 2 is an OLTP
database, then there are going to be cases when large queries on its
contents will fail.</p>

<p>This realization led to the introduction, beginning in the early 2000s,
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse_appliance"><em>[data warehouse
appliances]{.underline}</em></a>,
notably Netezza.</p>

<p><img src="/whitepapers/img/spark/image8.png" alt="" /><img src="/whitepapers/img/spark/image12.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Figure 3</p>

<p>The Netezza platform was a parallel computer that could perform very
fast SQL queries on large datasets and had other features that made it
suitable for use as a data warehousing platform. Beginning in 2003,
Netezza started being sold as a platform for data warehouses, often
replacing Oracle as the data warehouse platform in Figure 2. In time,
other solutions suitable for the right side of Figure 3 became
available, such as Amazon Redshift. Apache Spark, a cluster platform, is
one of the latest of these.</p>

<p>Some common advantages of these solutions over the OLTP databases they
replaced are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They are much better at supporting “data-warehouse-type” queries –
    <blockquote>
      <p>that is, joins or other queries involving millions or billions of
rows.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are orders of magnitude less expensive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are easier to maintain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have a smaller footprint.</p>
  </li>
  <li>They are not necessarily smaller in terms of actual storage.</li>
</ul>

<p>The effect of these new technologies on the world of data warehousing
was rapid and conspicuous; one would no longer find attempts to build
serious DWs on OLTP databases.</p>

<p>But what about the rest of the picture? Do the changes on the right-hand
of Figure 2 side have consequences for the ETL server as well? Indeed,
they do since the ETL servers now represent an expensive <em>duplication of
resources</em>. The technologies now used on the right-hand side of the
diagram duplicate the capacities of the ETL server, which, in large
part, consist of efficiently carrying out join- and sort-like operations
on large datasets. The new DW platforms are, in effect, excellent
transformation engines themselves. Why not use them to replace the ETL
servers altogether? This suggests a simpler architecture, shown in
Figure 4:</p>

<p><img src="/whitepapers/img/spark/image10.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Figure 4</p>

<h3 id="elt-nothing-in-between">ELT: Nothing in-between</h3>

<p>The advantages of the ELT architecture over ETL are difficult to
overstate. They are best understood by simply comparing Figure 3 and
Figure 4. When a Figure 4 architecture is possible, removing the ETL
server confers the obvious benefits of reducing cost, reducing latency,
and removing a data volume bottleneck. Obtaining these benefits would
not only improve existing data warehouses; the reduced up-front cost,
footprint, and maintenance overhead could lead to data warehousing
resources being available to organizations for which they were
previously out of reach.</p>

<p>There are, however, benefits of the ETL server that are difficult to do
without. The ETL server is the platform for the ETL tools with which
developers are familiar – tools like DataStage, Informatica, and Ab
Initio. These tools relieve the developers of the necessity of writing
code in SQL, Scala, C++ or whatever language of the platform might be,
instead letting them program by constructing dataflows in a visual
language. The tools also provide important abstractions such as “jobs”.
“job sequences,” “job parameters,” and so on. For developers to
home-grow their own tools for these tasks is laborious and error-prone.
But if a data warehouse is to operate smoothly, reliably ingesting and
processing data day after day, these tools are critical.</p>

<h3 id="eltmaestro-for-spark">ELTMaestro for Spark</h3>

<p>How, then, can we have our cake and eat it too? How can we get the
architectural advantages of Figure 4 – dispensing with the ETL server,
saving that money, and realizing those performance gains – without
giving up the conveniences that tools like DataStage and Informatica
provide? That is precisely the purpose of ELTMaestro.</p>

<p>ELTMaestro’s reason for existence is to <em>enable</em> the architecture shown
in Figure 4. An edition of ELTMaestro exists for each supported platform
that can be used on the right-hand side. We are proud, in this paper, to
announce that these platforms now include Apache Spark.</p>

<h3 id="agents-for-secure-extraction-and-communication">Agents for secure extraction and communication</h3>

<p>ETL servers have another role which we cannot ignore; they also extract
data from sources. In cloud-based environments, extracted data may need
to move across the open internet; this adds a dimension of security
concerns that need to be addressed.</p>

<p>ELTMaestro extracts data from remote sources by using a scheme of
<em>agents.</em> Agents are processes installed on data sources that know how
to communicate with the target. Any number of agents may be installed on
a source, and any number of agents can be installed overall. When a
connection to a source is requested, the first responding agent that can
support that connection is used. Multiplexing may occur when another
connection to the same source is sought; in this case another, unused
agent may reply and support the second connection. By supporting
multiplexing, agents help the enterprise maintain a degree of control
over bandwidth in a Cloud implementation.</p>

<p>Agents take care of encrypting and compressing data communication
between source and target (using AES 256-bit encryption) alleviating the
concern of eavesdropping.</p>

<p>Agents also help to maintain data security because the data sources
where they reside tend to be inside internal networks where they are
invisible to the outside world. The agent can see the target machine,
and can initiate communication with the target machine, but the target
machine can’t see the agent, other than to respond to its queries.
Agents maintain contact with the target machine by pinging the target
every few seconds, to see if there are requests for their data. If there
are, a connection is established and data is sent to the target. The
target never needs to know the IP address of the source, which helps to
prevent illegitimate connections.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Apache Spark represents a potential revolution in data warehousing.</p>

<p>The cost and performance profile of Apache Spark means that data
warehousing resources that were once only available to Fortune 500
companies with vast IT budgets are now available to very moderate-size
firms with limited means.</p>

<p>Traditional ETL architecture is simply a stumbling block preventing this
revolution. By enabling developers with the tools they need to build and
maintain data warehouses with a platform architecture that makes sense,
we are simply removing this stumbling block, and letting the revolution
move forward.</p>
