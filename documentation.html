<p class="lead"> Get started using Integrator, the worlds best ELT software package.</p>
<h2 class="pt-3"> Quick Start </h2>

<h2 class="pt-3"> Introduction </h2>
  <p>Integrator is a tool that helps you do data integration and build data warehouses on powerful platforms such as IBM PureData for Analytics (Netezza), Amazon RedShift, Apache Spark, and other systems. </p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Integrator Concepts</h2>


<h4 class="pt-3">Job</h4>
 A job is a reusable component that does some defined work.  A single job may read from one or more data sources and write to one or more targets.  In most cases, the processing within a job is atomic and consistent, meaning the job as a whole will either completely succeed or fail.  Data will either be committed or rolled back to its pre-job state based on job success or failure.  In either case, the Integrator engine will clean up and remove all temporary tables and other intermediate processing artifacts.
<h4 class="pt-3">Batch</h4>
 A batch is a collection of jobs that are run together.  The batch defines the order in which the component jobs are run.  Jobs within a batch are connected by a graph which illustrates how control flow passes from job to job, as shown below.

<h4 class="pt-3">Workflow</h4>
 We use the term workflow to refer to jobs or batches. A workflow can execute multiple network of workflows and can have infinite hierarchy.

<h4 class="pt-3">Step</h4>
 Just as jobs are the components of batches, steps are the components of jobs.  Consider the following example: A job might extract data from two tables, combine the two datasets, massage the data into the form required by a target table, and then load the data to the target.  Such a job might be composed of the following operations: (1) Extract the data from the first source, (2) extract data from the second source, (3) join the two datasets, and (4) load the resulting dataset into the target table.  Such a job would be composed of four steps, as shown below.
