				Benefits

			<div class="row px-0 px-sm-5">
				<div class="col-md">
					<h3 class="mb-3"><i class="fas fa-fire pr-3 loadtrans "></i>Speed</h3>
					<p>Bottlenecks in data integration processes happen at computational boundaries:  landing data to disk or transferring data across a network.
					Eliminating a server from the series of machines that data passes through on its way from source to target will confer a significant performance advantage.
					This is all the more true when the machine that is eliminated (the ETL server) is resource-bound relative to the machine that replaces it (the target data integration server – generally an MPP purpose-built platform or cluster).
						The result:  ELT architectures have significant speed advantages over traditional architectures.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md">
					<h3 class="mb-3 "><i class="fas fa-dollar-sign pr-3 loadtrans"></i>Cost</h3>
					<p>Traditional ETL systems contain powerful engines that implement efficient joins, sorts, filters and other operations on large datasets.  To work well, these systems require powerful dedicated servers.  These servers become sources for data integration servers – which, ironically, are even more powerful servers that are more capable of performing the joins, sorts, filters, and other large dataset operations than the ETL servers are.  The traditional ETL systems have become, for historical reasons, costly duplications of effort.  To eliminate the ETL servers and make the data integration servers perform in the required role, however, some inexpensive “glue” is required.  ELTMaestro is that glue.  The result:  ELTMaestro is an order of magnitude less expensive than the ETL systems it replaces.  ETLMaestro essentially eliminates the cost of traditional ETL systems.</p>

				<div class="col-md">
					<h3 class="mb-3 "><i class="fas fa-star pr-3 loadtrans"></i>Ease of use</h3>
					<p>ELTMaestro is designed to look and feel familiar to the users of traditional ETL systems such as Informatica and DataStage.  ELTMaestro users write data integration programs using an intuitive visual dataflow language where icons connected by arrows represent sources, operations, and targets of data.  ELTMaestro presents users with a hierarchy of jobs and batches which can be readily integrated into production environments.  ELTMaestro provides parameters to control job behavior and to pass information between jobs.  ELTMaestro has debug modes and log information to help developers determine what is going wrong with their programs.  The result:  ELTMaestro is easy for anyone to learn and use.  For users of traditional ETL systems, ELTMaestro will look and feel familiar.</p>
